Here's how you would perform all types of joins (Inner, Left, Right, and Full Outer) and create views on the Student and Course tables.
Create the Tables
1.	Student Table:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentName VARCHAR(50),
    CourseID INT
);

INSERT INTO Student (StudentID, StudentName, CourseID) VALUES
(1, 'Amita', 101),
(2, 'Neha', 102),
(3, 'Sagar', 103),
(4, 'Sneha', 106),
(5, 'Shubham', 105);
2.	Course Table:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Course (
    CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CourseName VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO Course (CourseID, CourseName) VALUES
(101, 'Physics'),
(102, 'Chemistry'),
(104, 'Biology');
1. Perform All Types of Joins
•	Inner Join: 
Copy code

SELECT * FROM student INNER JOIN Course ON student.CourseID=Course.CourseID;


•	Left Join: 
Copy code
 SELECT * FROM student LEFT JOIN Course ON student.CourseID=Course.CourseID;


•	Right Join: 
Copy code
SELECT * FROM student RIGHT JOIN Course ON student.CourseID=Course.CourseID;


•	Full Outer Join:
Copy code
SELECT * FROM student LEFT JOIN Course ON student.CourseID=Course.CourseID union SELECT * FROM student RIGHT JOIN Course ON student.CourseID=Course.CourseID;



2. Create and Display Different Views
VEIWS:-

 CREATE VIEW vv AS SELECT StudentName FROM student;

select * from vv;
